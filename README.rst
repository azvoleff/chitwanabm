chitwanabm: an agent-based model of the western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.
 
Model Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

chitwanabm is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.  The 
model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a number of 
agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), environmental 
variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social context variables.

Construction of the model is supported as part of an ongoing National Science 
Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education (NSF PIRE) 
project `(grant OISE 0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_ investigating 
human-environment interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley. Development of 
the model is in progress, and model documentation is still incomplete.

See the `chitwanabm website 
<http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/ChitwanABM.php>`_ for more 
information, past releases, publications, and recent presentations.

.. note:: The model requires restricted access survey data from the
    Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) to run. See the  `Interuniversity 
    Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) page on the CVFS 
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04538>`_ for more information.
