ChitwanABM INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

DEPENDENCIES
        ChitwanABM has been tested to be functionatl on Linux, Windows 7, and 
    Mac OS 10.6.4. The model needs a standard Python installation (2.6 has been 
    tested to be working) along with several Python dependencies.
    
    Dependencies:
        Python:
            A python installation is required to run the model. I use Python 
        2.6, but 2.5 should work as well. The model will not run under Python 
        3.0.
        Python Dependencies:
            Numpy - Numpy is required.

            Matplotlib - Matplotlib is required (to enable the automatic 
                plotting of the results of each model run).

            Psyco (optional) - Pysco is optional, but will speed up model runs.

            OGR (optional) - OGR is required to output shapefiles of 
                neighborhoods locations

        R and R packages (optional):
                Several R scripts are used to initialize the model, to 
            generate synthetic populations to be used for running the model 
            (if the ICPSR restricted data from the CVFS survey is unavailable), 
            and for automated plotting of model results. If you do not have R 
            installed, you will need to set the parameter "make_plots" to 
            "False" in your ChitwanABMrc file.

            R packages used in model initialization and results plotting:
                foreign
                ggplot2
                Hmisc

        Git (optional)

MODEL INSTALLATION
        To get the model, simply download the latest stable version of the 
    code from:
        http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/ChitwanABM.html

    The development snapshot (latest version of the code, but it may not always 
    be functional) can be downloaded from:
        http://git.azvoleff.com/ChitwanABM/snapshot

    The development source can also be downloaded via git from:
        git://git.azvoleff.com/ChitwanABM

        To install the model, simply unzip the code into a folder on your 
    computer.  After installing Python and the dependencies listed above, you 
    will need to add the folder containing the model to your computer's Python 
    path so that the code modules will load correctly.

    Adding ChitwanABM directory to Python path on Linux and Mac OS:
            On Linux and Mac OS, you will need to add a line to your user 
        profile telling Python where the ChitwanABM files are located. You can 
        do this one of two ways. To temporarily add the ChitwanABM path to your 
        Python path, open XTerm and type:
            export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ChitwanABM/folder
        Replace "/path/to/ChitwanABM/folder" with the correct full path to the 
        ChitwanABM folder. For example, if the code is on your desktop, this 
        might be "/Users/azvoleff/Desktop/ChitwanABM" on a Mac, or 
        "/home/azvoleff/Desktop/ChitwanABM" on Linux.

        To make this change permanent, add the line
            export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/ChitwanABM/folder
        to the ".profile" file in your home directory.
