ChitwanABM - README.txt

Western Chitwan Valley Agent-based model

'ChitwanABM' is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal. The 
model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a number of 
agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), environmental 
variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social context variables.

The ChitwanABM model relies on restricted access data from the Chitwan Valley 
Family Study (see below) to generate the agents that populate the model. This 
restricted access data can be obtained by contacting the Inter-university 
Consortium for Political and Social Research (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/). 

The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation research 
at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of Geography. Contact 
Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
