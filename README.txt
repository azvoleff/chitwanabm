MODEL NAME:
    ChitwanABM - an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.
 
DESCRIPTION:
    'ChitwanABM' is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal. 
    The model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a 
    number of agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), 
    environmental variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social 
    context variables.

    The ChitwanABM model relies on restricted access data from the Chitwan 
    Valley Family Study (see below) to generate the agents that populate the 
    model. This restricted access data can be obtained by contacting the 
    Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research 
    (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/). 

    The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation 
    research at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of 
    Geography. Contact Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
