The ChitwanABM
=============================
'ChitwanABM' is an agent-based model of the Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal.  The 
model represents a subset of the population of the Valley using a number of 
agent types (person, household and neighborhood agents), environmental 
variables (topography, land use and land cover) and social context variables.

Construction of the model is supported as part of an ongoing National Science 
Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education (NSF PIRE) 
project `(grant OISE 0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_ investigating 
human-environment interactions in the Western Chitwan Valley. Development of 
the model is in progress, and model documentation is still incomplete.  As work 
continues, this page will be updated with more information on initializing and 
running the model, and on interpreting the model output.

.. note:: The model requires restricted access survey data from the
    Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) to run. See the  `Interuniversity 
    Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) page on the CVFS 
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04538>`_ for more information.
